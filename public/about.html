<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>LI'm a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in data analysis, software development, 
  and user-centered design. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, intuitive solutions and thrive in collaborative, fast-paced 
  environments. Whether I’m analyzing datasets to uncover insights or building tools that improve workflows, I’m always eager to learn 
  and contribute meaningfully. With a strong foundation in both technical and creative problem-solving, I’m driven to make an impact
  through thoughtful, practical innovation.

<p>Recently, I’ve worked on a range of projects spanning real-time data processing, machine learning, and full-stack development. 
  From developing a real-time clustering pipeline using Kafka and Spark Streaming to designing user-friendly interfaces for web 
  applications, I enjoy diving into challenges that blend creativity with technical rigor. I'm especially interested in roles where
   I can continue to grow, contribute to impactful products, and collaborate with teams that value curiosity, initiative,
  and continuous improvement.</p>
